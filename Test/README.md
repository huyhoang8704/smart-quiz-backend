# Test project for smart-quiz-backend

This folder contains a standalone test project for the backend code. It is intentionally separate from `Backend/` so you can run tests independently.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
Set-Location -Path 'F:\smart-quiz-backend\Test'
npm install
npm test
```
